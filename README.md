# calculator

This project is an assignment from the Odin Project.

This is a simple calculator web application that calculates the result of a number being operated on by another number. The operations include divison, multiplication, subtraction, and addition.

There is support for displaying floating point numbers as well as support for users to enter floating point numbers using the decimal point button.

This application allows users to chain operations so that users don't have to constantly hit the "equals" button if they need to take a result and then operate on that result with another number.

The styled theme behind the application is inspired by the Calculator app for iOS devices.
